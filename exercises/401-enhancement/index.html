<h2>Exercise: What should we test for to enhance our page?</h2>
<section class="level3" id="recall">
<h3>Recall</h3>
<p>All answers must be &quot;yes&quot;:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Can we use JavaScript to select, traverse and manipulate DOM nodes in the way we'd like in this browser?</li>
<li>Does this browser support media queries?</li>
<li>Is the wider-screen media query applied?</li>
<li>Does this browser support generated content?</li>
<li>Does this browser support CSS counters?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Let's assume that the answer to #1 is yes (if the JS containing the tests is evaluated, that by default answers question 1)</li>
<li><em>Hint</em>: The answers to 2 and 3 are interrelated. Suggest looking at #3 first.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the <a href="http://modernizr.com/docs/">Modernizr documentation</a>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Which Modernizr feature test(s) should we use to answer question 4 above?</li>
<li>Which Modernizr feature could help us with question 3 and 2 above?</li>
<li><em>For the JS-inclined</em>: Take a look at <code>Modernizr.load</code> (if you are not familiar with it). How could it help us in our endeavors here?</li>
<li><em>Challenge question</em>: There is no Modernizr test for CSS counter support. How can we try to assure that counters are supported?</li>
