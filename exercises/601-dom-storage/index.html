<h2>Exercise: Research localStorage</h2>
<section class="level3" id="premise">
<h3>Premise</h3>
<p>Recall that the last state of our Shakespeare scene contained popups with two buttons: <code>Save</code> and <code>Close</code>. Right now, both buttons simply close the popup. I mocked up the <code>Save</code> button so that I could test the styling, but now it's time to think about how we'd actually save things.</p>

</figure>
<p>For the implementation of the &quot;save&quot; functionality, <strong>I have opted for the simple <code>localStorage</code> API</strong>.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<li>What is <code>Web Storage</code>?</li>
<li>What is <code>localStorage</code>'s relationship to Web Storage?</li>
<li>Which browsers support Web Storage? Which don't?</li>
<li>Find at least two polyfills for localStorage.</li>

<h3>For your consideration</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do you notice a difference in what different sites claim about the status of Web Storage? If so, what do you think might be the reason(s)?</li>
<li>Can you think of a reasonable chain of enhancement to use during implementation of localStorage in our Shakespeare scene to minimize unpleasant experiences? What are some failure modes?</li>
<li>If you are JavaScript savvy or generally curious (and don't already have experience with localStorage), do a bit of Googling for the API details themselves (objects, methods, events).</li>
