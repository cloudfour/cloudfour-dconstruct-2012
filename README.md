# Welcome!

## Structure of your stuff

1. Presentation and slides
    * HTML5 slide show presentation is in two pieces: `part1.html` and `part2.html`, roughly equating to morning and afternoon of the all-day workshop. This is the same presentation that I will be using.
    * If you are having connectivity or display problems, you may use `part1-flat.html` and `part2-flat.html`. These are unrolled HTML files. Less fun, less pretty, but should get the job done.
1. Exercises
    * Exercises with some interactive (i.e. you do parts of them) components are in the `exercises` directory. Links from the presentation lead to the relevant exercises at the relevant times
    * The `presenter-exercises` directory holds comprehensive code examples for the entire workshop, for your reference
